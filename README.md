The development of a country depends on the village’s development. 
As part of the smart village concept, we need a system that helps in development of villages in the
areas like Primary education, people’s healthcare, Roads and Transportation, Drinking water facilities, 
government policies awareness and availability of basic facilities/infrastructure. This system helps
the members to collaborate, plan, assess and implement different activities and learn with others experience/feedbacks and suggestions.
